# TASK 2 :
RISC V Instruction Set pattern


RISC V instructions are each of 32 bits or 4 bytes
These aredivided into fields.
There are 6 instruction formats 
1. Register type formats : This uses 3 register inputs Eg : add, mul, AND - All are basically arithmetic and logical operations
he RISC-V instruction set includes six types of instructions1
2:I-type: immediate and load operations 
Eg: addi r12,r4,5
    lw x14,x2,8
3.S-type: store operations 
Eg: sw x12, x2,8
4.B-type: conditional branch operations 
Eg: beq r0, r0 ,15
    bne r0, r1,20
5.U-type: long immediate operation
